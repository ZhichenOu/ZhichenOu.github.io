Welcome to my page!😊

I'm currently an Economics student at University of Bonn. This is my second year in Germany and I'm about to graduate next year.🎓

My study interest lies in Corporate Finance, Accounting and Applied Microeconomics.💭

I live in Bonn now, a cozy and beautiful city. In my spare time, I usually play badminton and do some aerobic exercise.😎

I love reading novels, especially detective novels, my favourite author is Keigo Higashino.📖
