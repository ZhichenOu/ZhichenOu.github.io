Welcome to my page! This is Zhichen.😊

I'm currently an Economics student at [University of Bonn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Bonn). This is my second year in Germany and I'm about to graduate next year.🎓

My study interest lies in Corporate Finance, Accounting and Applied Microeconomics.💭

I live in Bonn now, a cozy and beautiful city. In my spare time, I usually play badminton and do some aerobic exercise.😎

I love reading novels, especially detective novels, my favourite author is [Keigo Higashino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keigo_Higashino).📖
